# ü§ñ CAPTCHA Boss Fight


## Basic Details
### Team Name: GGEZ

### Project Description  
An absurdly intense typing game where you fight a sassy robot boss by defeating CAPTCHAs with sheer speed and accuracy. It‚Äôs like a typing test... if the fate of the digital world depended on it.

---

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Robots are taking over the internet because humans can‚Äôt type CAPTCHAs fast enough. It‚Äôs chaos. Someone had to do something.

---

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We built an epic boss battle game where your weapon is your keyboard. Type CAPTCHAs at blazing speed, crush the robot overlord, and save humanity (or at least feel productive).
